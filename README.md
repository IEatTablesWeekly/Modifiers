## What is Modifiers?

The **Modifiers** Add-on for *Minecraft Bedrock Edition* introduces a system of **randomly-assigned modifiers** to tools and armor. Each item has a chance to gain a **buff** or **debuff**, creating unique gear every time and enhancing the gameplay loop with a touch of randomness and RPG flavor. Inspiried by the Modifiers mod by Cursed1nferno on *Minecraft Java Edition*.
