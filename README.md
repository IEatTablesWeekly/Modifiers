# ðŸ”§ Modifiers Add-on

The **Modifiers** Add-on for *Minecraft Bedrock Edition* introduces a dynamic system of **randomly-assigned modifiers** to tools and armor. These modifiers provide small **buffs** or **debuffs**, adding an exciting layer of progression and unpredictability to your gameplay.

Equip a sword with enhanced speed, or maybe a helmet that slightly reduces your max health â€” the possibilities keep every item feel fresh and unique!

ðŸŽ® **Fully compatible with Minecraft Bedrock 1.21**

ðŸ§ª Ideal for survival, RPG-style worlds, or custom modpacks looking for more variety and depth.
